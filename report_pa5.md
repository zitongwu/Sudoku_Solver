## Description: 
1. The GSAT algorithm is a local search algorithm. It takes clauses in conjunctive normal form as input and ouputs the correct assignment if one is found or False if none is found. In the algorithm, it first assigns random True(1) or False(0) value to each variable. While the current assignment doesn't satisfy all the CNF clauses (constraints), with probability h, it flips the value of a random varible in the current assignment; with propability 1-h, it scores for each variable how many clauses would be satisfied if the variable value were flipped, chooses randomly one of the variables with the highest score, and flips its value in the current assignment. **So there are both randomness and greediness in the GSAT algorithm. It is hoped that with these two features the GSAT algorithm will find the solution faster than a naive model checking.**


2. The WALKSAT algorithm works similarly, except that it doesn't consider all variables for flipping each time. While the current assignment doesn't satisfy all the CNF clauses (constraints), it chooses randomly one of the clauses that are not not satisfied by the current assignment. With probability p, it chooses one variable randomly from the chosen unsatisfied clause to flip. With probability 1-p, it scores for each variable in the chosen unsatisfied clause how many clauses would be satisfied if the variable value were flipped,  chooses randomly one of the variables with the highest score, and flips its value in the current assignment. **The WALKSAT algorithm is faster than the GSAT algoirhtm because it is more greedy: it considers only those variables in the clauses that are not satisfied by the current assignment to be flipped.** 



## Evaluation: 
1. Both algorithms work. 
2. However, the GSAT algorithm takes longer to run. Thus I didn't test it fully. It found the correct solution for `one_cell.cnf` and `one_row.cnf`.
3. The WALKSAT algoirhtm found solutions for all test `cnf` files. Below are the solutions it found for puzzle1 and puzzle2.
